# Face Recognition using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Face Recognition** system using deep learning techniques. The model detects and recognizes faces from images or video streams, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Face detection using **Haar Cascades / MTCNN / SSD** (specify which one is used).  
- Feature extraction with a **pretrained CNN model** (e.g., FaceNet, VGG-Face, or custom CNN).  
- Face embedding comparison for recognition.  
- Real-time face recognition support (if applicable).  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Uses a **public face dataset** (mention the dataset name if applicable) or custom image data.  
- Images are preprocessed (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization).  

## 🛠️ Installation  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have Python installed. Install required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
or manually install:  
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow keras matplotlib
```  

## 🏃 Usage  
### 1️⃣ Run Face Recognition  
To execute the notebook, open it in Jupyter and run all cells:  
```bash
jupyter notebook FaceRecognition.ipynb
```  

### 2️⃣ Run in Python Script (if available)  
```bash
python face_recognition.py
``` 

## 🔥 Results  
- Displays detected and recognized faces.  
- Can be integrated into applications requiring identity verification.  

## 📜 Future Improvements  
- Improve accuracy with a larger dataset.  
- Implement real-time face recognition in video streams.  
- Optimize model inference speed for deployment.
